* Usage

Evaluate =utils2.el= and =server.el= in your emacs, and run
#+begin_src shell
npm start
#+end_src

* TODO

The redisplay function is very slow. This is the main bottle neck of the
project.

=after-change-functions= actually enables a finer control to what is changed.
Try that. In that works, whenever emacs received a key, it doesn't have to
redraw all the text IF (1) text wasn't changed AND IF (2) peekable beg/end
didn't change.

* NOTE [2025-12-06 Sat]

I just realized that emacs must have calculated some minimal data before
calculating them into pixels. I should find them and use them for candidates
to pipe to the browser.
