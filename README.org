** NEXT Compute what to show in Emacs

Heavy computations should be done in emacs.

In particular, what it should send to the web page is a sequence of
characters. Each character may have its own property.

** Write a function for each of the following steps.

#+begin_quote
1. [X] Emacs State -> Peekable (Propertied) Buffer String and Overlays
2. [X]             -> Json String
3. [X]             -> Json String [via WebSocket]
4. [ ]             -> Presentable Characters
5. [ ]             -> Document Operations
6. [ ]             -> Effects
#+end_quote

** Page Starts: Start Listening to Emacs WebSocket Server.
